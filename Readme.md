# DS 775 Prescriptive Analytics - Materials for Class

Here you'll find all of the materials you need to download for the homework and exams.

This material is under construction and will be updated throughout the semester.  At present Lessons 1-3 are ready.

## Homework Sets

For each week there is a download folder containing the homework problems and instructions. The easiest way to view the homework is probably the html file in each folder.  To work on the homework edit the Word document or the R markdown file.

## Homework and Exam Solutions + Exam Materials

These materials are stored in encrypted 7-zip files.  The passwords will be released in your course management system at the appropriate times.  To open these you'll need to [download and install software to decompress 7-zip files](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).  Scroll to the bottom of the page if you don't run Windows.  I use Keka for Mac.
